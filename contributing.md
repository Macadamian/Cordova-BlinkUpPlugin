How to Contribute
================

Forking both `https://github.com/Macadamian/Cordova-BlinkUpSample` and `https://github.com/Macadamian/Cordova-BlinkUpPlugin` is recommended. Note that `BlinkUpSample` should only contain UI contributions. Plugin fixes belong in `BlinkUpPlugin`.

1. When you have a fork, start working on a topic branch based on your own private fork.
    a. Ensure you follow the process as referred in https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
2. Make your changes on that branch.
    a. To test your branch, we recommend using the `UpdatePluginLocally.sh` script and test the patch in the Sample Application.
    b. Note that for IOS you may be forced to re-add the plugin files to the Build Phase `Compiling Sources`
3. When you are ready, commit your changes on your topic branch, and push the changes to your private fork. Be very descriptive in your commit message.
4. Submit a pull request against the `master` branch of the `https://github.com/Macadamian/Cordova-BlinkUpSample` and `https://github.com/Macadamian/Cordova-BlinkUpPlugin` repositories.
5. Someone will look at the Pull Request, ask questions, and address any feedback.
6. When we are comfortable with your patch, we will merge it in the repository!


What we will not do
==================
Provide you with a BlinkUp SDK, or API Keys. You need to reach out to Electric Imp to get this.

Missing Features
=================
The API currently does not offer a mechanism to do custom branded blinkup screens.
